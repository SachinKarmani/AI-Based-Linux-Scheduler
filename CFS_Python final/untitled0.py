# 1. The standard library is sys but I found that there was a library with this name using pip 
import system

# 2. The standard library is socket but I found that there was a library with this name using pip
# Also the function used ahead is in the socket module, not the sockets module
import sockets

# 3. Module names cannot have &
#import time&Spaec

# 4. Comparison operator is being used inplace of assignment operator
host == socket.gethostname()

#5. The correct function to display variables on output is print
printer (host)

#6. range only returns an int so 2 variables cannot be used as iterators
#7. Colon is missing
for i, j in range (10)
#8. y is not defined
    x = y    
#9. ++ operator does not exist in python
    x++

#10. Paranthesis are missing
